# 🛒 Vector-Based Recommendation System

Welcome to the **Vector-Based Recommendation System**! This project analyzes customer purchase history to generate personalized product recommendations. By calculating the similarity between items using **cosine similarity** and **vector angles**, it suggests relevant products to enhance the shopping experience.

## 🚀 How It Works

The recommendation system works by:
1. **Purchase History Analysis**: Each item is represented as a vector based on customer purchase data.
2. **Cosine Similarity**: It calculates the angle between item vectors. The smaller the angle, the higher the similarity between products.
3. **Recommendation**: When customers add items to their cart, the system identifies the most similar items not already in the cart and suggests them.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data manipulation and logic implementation.
- **NumPy**: For fast and efficient matrix operations, dot products, and vector computations.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Tailors product suggestions based on historical customer behavior.
- **Efficient Computation**: Uses vector angles and cosine similarity for quick and accurate item comparisons.
- **Scalable**: Can be extended to work with larger datasets and more complex shopping behaviors.

## 📂 Files
- **`history.txt`**: Sample customer purchase data (transactions).
- **`queries.txt`**: Sample shopping cart queries to test the recommendation system.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/vector-recommendation-system.git
    ```
2. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    ```
3. Run the recommendation system:
    ```bash
    python recommendation_system.py
    ```

## 📈 Example Output
Given a shopping cart, the system will output personalized recommendations:
```bash
Shopping cart: 1 2
Item: 1; match: 5; angle: 15.76
Item: 2; no match
Recommend: 5
```

## 🌟 Why This Project?
This system can be used in **e-commerce platforms** to recommend products based on customer behavior, enhancing user experience and potentially boosting sales. The **cosine similarity** approach ensures that recommendations are highly relevant.
